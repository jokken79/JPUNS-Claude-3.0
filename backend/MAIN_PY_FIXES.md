# main.py Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the fixes and improvements made to `backend/app/main.py` to address potential issues and enhance the application's robustness.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Middleware Order Correction ✅
**Problem**: The middleware order was incorrect. Exception handling middleware should be the outermost to catch all errors.

**Solution**: Reordered middleware stack:
```python
# Correct order (outermost first, processes response last)
app.add_middleware(ExceptionHandlerMiddleware)  # Catches all exceptions
app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)           # Logs requests/responses
app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware)          # Adds security headers
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)         # Handles CORS
app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, ...)  # Validates hosts
```

**Impact**: Better error handling and consistent logging of all requests, including error cases.

---

### 2. TrustedHostMiddleware Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Production configuration used a string instead of a list for `allowed_hosts`.

**Solution**: 
```python
# Before
app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=["*" if settings.DEBUG else "uns-kikaku.com"])

# After
app.add_middleware(
    TrustedHostMiddleware,
    allowed_hosts=["*"] if settings.DEBUG else ["uns-kikaku.com", "*.uns-kikaku.com", "localhost"]
)
```

**Impact**: Proper production security with wildcard subdomain support.

---

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling for Directory Creation ✅
**Problem**: Directory creation could fail silently, causing issues later.

**Solution**: 
```python
try:
    os.makedirs(settings.UPLOAD_DIR, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(settings.LOG_FILE), exist_ok=True)
    app_logger.info("Required directories created/verified")
except Exception as exc:
    app_logger.warning(f"Could not create directories: {exc}")
```

**Impact**: Better visibility of directory creation issues and proper logging.

---

### 4. Safe Static Files Mounting ✅
**Problem**: Static files mounting could fail if directory doesn't exist or isn't a directory.

**Solution**: 
```python
try:
    if os.path.exists(settings.UPLOAD_DIR) and os.path.isdir(settings.UPLOAD_DIR):
        app.mount("/uploads", StaticFiles(directory=settings.UPLOAD_DIR), name="uploads")
        app_logger.info(f"Mounted static files from {settings.UPLOAD_DIR}")
except Exception as exc:
    app_logger.warning(f"Could not mount static files: {exc}")
```

**Impact**: Application starts even if static files mounting fails, with proper error logging.

---

### 5. Improved Startup Event Handler ✅
**Problem**: Limited logging and no fail-fast behavior in production.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced logging with structured data
- Added configuration summary logging
- Fail-fast in production if database initialization fails
- Better exception messages

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def on_startup() -> None:
    """Application startup event handler."""
    app_logger.info(
        "Starting application",
        app_name=settings.APP_NAME,
        version=settings.APP_VERSION,
        environment=settings.ENVIRONMENT,
        debug=settings.DEBUG,
    )
    
    try:
        init_db()
        app_logger.info("Database tables initialized successfully")
    except Exception as exc:
        app_logger.exception("Database initialization failed", error=str(exc))
        if not settings.DEBUG:
            app_logger.critical("Cannot start application without database")
            raise
    
    app_logger.info(
        "Application configuration",
        cors_origins=len(settings.BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS),
        upload_dir=settings.UPLOAD_DIR,
        ocr_enabled=settings.OCR_ENABLED,
    )
```

**Impact**: Better production safety and more informative startup logs.

### 6. Enhanced Health Check Endpoint ✅
**Problem**: Health endpoint didn't verify database connectivity.

**Solution**: 
- Added database connectivity check
- Returns detailed health status including version and environment
- Uses proper SQLAlchemy text() for queries
- Graceful degradation (returns "degraded" status if DB is down)

```python
@app.get("/api/health")
async def health_check() -> dict:
    """Health check endpoint with database connectivity verification."""
    health_status = {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "version": settings.APP_VERSION,
        "environment": settings.ENVIRONMENT,
    }
    
    # Check database connectivity
    try:
        from app.core.database import SessionLocal
        db = SessionLocal()
        try:
            db.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
            health_status["database"] = "connected"
        except Exception as db_exc:
            health_status["database"] = "disconnected"
            health_status["status"] = "degraded"
        finally:
            db.close()
    except Exception as exc:
        health_status["database"] = "error"
        health_status["status"] = "degraded"
    
    return health_status
```

**Impact**: Better health monitoring for production deployments and load balancers.

### 7. Router Import Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Router import failures would cause cryptic errors.

**Solution**: 
```python
try:
    from app.api import (
        auth, candidates, azure_ocr, dashboard, employees,
        factories, import_export, monitoring, notifications,
        reports, requests, salary, timer_cards,
    )
    
    # Register all routers...
    
    app_logger.info("All API routers registered successfully")
except ImportError as exc:
    app_logger.exception("Failed to import API routers", error=str(exc))
    raise
except Exception as exc:
    app_logger.exception("Failed to register API routers", error=str(exc))
    raise
```

**Impact**: Clearer error messages when router imports fail, easier debugging.

---

## Testing

New comprehensive tests were added in `backend/tests/api/test_main.py`:

- ✅ Root endpoint returns correct data
- ✅ Health endpoint includes database status
- ✅ 404 handler works correctly
- ✅ CORS headers are present
- ✅ Security headers are properly set
- ✅ Performance timing header is added

Run tests with:
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/api/test_main.py -v
```

---

## Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. The API responses and behaviors remain the same, with additional information in the health endpoint.

### Health Endpoint Changes
**Before:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T15:00:00"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T15:00:00",
  "version": "2.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

---

## Deployment Notes

No additional configuration or deployment steps required. The changes are drop-in replacements that improve robustness and observability.

### Production Benefits
1. **Better Error Handling**: Application fails fast in production if critical services are unavailable
2. **Improved Monitoring**: Health endpoint now provides detailed status for monitoring systems
3. **Enhanced Security**: Proper TrustedHostMiddleware configuration
4. **Better Logging**: Structured logs for easier troubleshooting

### Development Benefits
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Application starts even with partial failures (e.g., DB unavailable)
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clearer logs when things go wrong
3. **Easier Debugging**: Comprehensive test suite
